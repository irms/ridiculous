 The Woodpeckers are a strange group in that they are nearly insane from constantly jarring their brains by pecking at the trees located in their habitat.  They have a habit of talking at insane speeds, mostly because they live by the credo that everything they do needs to be as fast as possible.  Eccentric as they are, however, they still view themselves as friends of the other animals, and will gladly save them before escaping themselves if they can.
