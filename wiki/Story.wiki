The Boulder Zoo's animals are in danger. The owner of the Zoo, with backing from the corrupt zoo executives, has decided to sell out and make money off the exotic animals in captivity. The zoo owner is going to sell the animals to Zoo'd Food, a company the professes to return these animals to the wild when in fact they turn exotic animals into delicacies for the rich and powerful.

Twelve hours before the truck is to arrive and transport the animals to certain death, ponco the flamingo overhears two guards discussing the fate of the animals. Poncho knows it is up to him to formulate a plan to get all of the animals to freedom. He must free the animals one by one, using each animal's unique skills to help free the other animals. Can you help the unfortuane animals at the Boulder Zoo escape, or will you fail, sealing their doom?

The game progresses when the player uses each animal's individual, class specific, skills. An example would be poncho the flamingo is only able to free the turtles (Jorge, Santiago, Miercoles). The turtles are then able to free the kangaroo, panda, or giraffe. If the player decides to free the kangaroo, he or she must then free the meerkat's, then the woodpecker, and lastly the elephant who is able to open the gate in that order. If the player chooses neither the kangaroo nor the panda, that leaves just the giraffe to free, then the meerkat, tiger, and elephant in that order.
