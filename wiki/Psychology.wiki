Criswell, Robert- Basically, I want to learn how a real game is made so I will be more prepared in the future if I decide to make a career out of it. Learning SVN and other such skills would also be important for many other jobs in a growing technological society and I want to keep up with the world.

Armi, David- My goal within this project is to better understand the overall psychology behind the making of video games for future application within the psychology aspect of the gaming industry.
