 The Turtles are an old and grumpy group, and don’t like being disturbed.  It is not uncommon for the turtles to sit around and complain about the younger animals and how they are too unruly.  They spend most of their time lying perfectly motionless underwater, and this extends into their personality; they never really like to have to move or do anything.  They have a tough and cold outside, but they’re still caring very, very deep down, and are willing and ready to act if it’s for an important cause.
