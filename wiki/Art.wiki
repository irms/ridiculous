*Williams, Crystal*- My goals are to improve with my artistic skills and speed without sacrificing quality. I look forward to the experience of working on a team of artists for the duration of this project and that we can share techniques and skills.

*Pizana, Shaylee*- I want one of my goals to be me saying flamingo instead of penguin. Another goal would be to see this project succeed. I would also like to successfully revert to Justin's style of drawing through the whole game.
